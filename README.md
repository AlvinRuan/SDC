# Product Overview Microservice

# Overview
The project's goal is to replace the existing API with a back end system that can support the increased traffic it is receiving. The specific microservice I'm tasked with is Product Overview. 

This is a monolithic repo and we are tasked with refactoring it to a microservice archtecture.
